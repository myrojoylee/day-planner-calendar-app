# DAY PLANNER APP

## Description

The purpose of the assignment was to create an interactive calendar application using jQuery. A template was given and the HTML and CSS was edited in order to reflect the hours of a typical 9AM - 5PM work day. Event handlers were added to the save icon at the end of each block in order to enable the use of local storage when a user enters an event. Block color was assigned by the addition/removal of classes by comparing current time to the time the user interacts with the app. Lastly, upon document load, should any events be in local storage on the same day, they would load upon document load which demonstrated the concept of persistent storage.

In this exercise I learned how to implement jQuery into my work to see how a JavaScript framework can be used to create an interactive web app.
